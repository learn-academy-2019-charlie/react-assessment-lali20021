// React Assessments

// 1. Write a simple React component that simply prints "I am a component" to the screen. Be sure to include all necessary imports, exports, etc...
import React, { Component } from 'react'

class Output extends Component{
  render(){
    return(
      <h1>I am a component</h1>
    )
  }
}
export default Output
// 2. Practice With Loops: In React, we often use the map function to iterate over an array held in state. To get more practice with this, write a vanilla javascript for loop that outputs the same thing as the map function below. 

var stuffArray = [42, "Arthur Dent", 1978, "Zaphod", "Vogon", "Marvin, the Paranoid Android"]
stuffArray.map(function(el, i){
  console.log(el + " is at index: " + i)
})

// your for loop here, you can use the same stuffArray array

var stuffArray = [42, "Arthur Dent", 1978, "Zaphod", "Vogon", "Marvin, the Paranoid Android"]
for (let i = 0; i < stuffArray.length; i++)
console.log(stuffArray[i] + " is at index: " + i);

// 3. Basic sorting: Find the cheapest price -- you are given a list of prices and need to find the signle lowest price from the array. Write a function that takes in an array of numbers, and returns the lowest price

const array = [7, 6, 11, 3, 15]
  var steal = function(array){
    return Math.min(...array)
  }
console.log(steal(array))
